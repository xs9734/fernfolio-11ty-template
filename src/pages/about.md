Hello! I'm David Cervantes, a passionate UX designer nestled in the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area. My journey into the world of design began at CSU East Bay, where I immersed myself in Art Multimedia, with a keen focus on interactivity.

Beyond the pixels and wireframes, you'll often find me lost in the world of 3D printing, exploring picturesque hiking trails, or indulging my curiosity by tinkering with electronics. These diverse interests fuel my creativity and provide fresh perspectives to my design approach.

Currently, I'm delving into the fascinating realm of RF/EMC/SAR in a lab in the serene town of Fremont. While my current role exposes me to the intricacies of electromagnetic fields, I'm eagerly poised to transition into the enriching world of UX design, where I can merge my technical expertise with my passion for crafting intuitive and impactful user experiences. 

My journey is just beginning, and I'm excited to channel my creativity, problem-solving skills, and love for innovation into every project I undertake.
