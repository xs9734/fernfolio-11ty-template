## Project Overview

Wundercat is a mobile app designed to simplify the cat food shopping experience, specifically tailored for cat parents dealing with picky eaters or those with dietary restrictions. By addressing the unique challenges faced by cat owners, Wundercat aims to redefine the way we care for our feline companions.

## My Role

For this project, I worked independently, taking on multiple roles throughout the design process. From initial concept ideation to final implementation, I was responsible for every stage of the project's development. My role encompassed:

* Conducting user research to understand user needs and pain points.
* Defining project goals and objectives based on research insights.
* Creating user personas and scenarios to guide the design process.
* Developing wireframes, prototypes, and user flows to visualize design concepts.
* Iteratively testing designs with potential users to gather feedback and make improvements.
* Conducting usability testing to validate the effectiveness of the final product.

## Understand

I began my research by visiting various cat food retailer websites to understand the information they provide on their product page. It became apparent that while some offered extensive details, others lacked sufficient information. Recognizing the importance of striking a balance, I aimed to find a middle ground. Too much information could overwhelm potential customers, while too little could leave them uninformed.

Additionally, I researched the dietary needs of cats and observed that many commercial foods contain ingredients unsuitable for obligate carnivores like cats. Despite their natural carnivorous diet, numerous products include grains and plant-based ingredients.

After conducting this research, I gained a clearer understanding of the questions to pose to survey participants. The aim of the survey was to determine the key information an individual seeks when buying cat food and ensure the design remained focused on addressing these aspects.

To conduct my survey I created a poster and posted this across town. People love cat memes so having a slightly funny poster depicting a cat would be a perfect way to grab people's attention. 

BÔªøased on survey responses a large majority to participants said the most important nutritional information they look for is Ingredients.
