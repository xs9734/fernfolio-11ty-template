A few days ago, while sifting through my emails and casually chatting with a coworker about food, she cheekily inquired about my next rendezvous with free Panda Express. You see, for a couple of years now, I've been moonlighting as a secret shopper (*not so secret now, I suppose...*), making my way to Panda Express every six months or so. It's a gig that earns me a few bucks and a complimentary meal, provided I navigate their scripted scenarios, gather intel, and submit a detailed report‚Äîall the while staying incognito, hidden in the shadows from the unsuspecting staff.

So that evening I go home, open the secret shopper app and perfect timing, new shops just dropped! I assign myself a shop for that same night. Of course, I do this through my computer since their website is not mobile friendly. It's like they're going for that secret agent vibe with a website that is as user friendly as a computer terminal from an 80s spy film.

After going through my scenario and taking the requested photos I sit down to enjoy my Panda Express meal (Chow Mein and Honey Walnut Shrimp). I then thought that instead of doom scrolling while eating I could complete the shop form through my phone, how bad could it be? It was bad. Something that would take me about 10 on my computer took 45 minutes, I had to start over twice after my data disappeared when I tried to save it.

After going back home I opened the form on my computer, took a full page screenshot, downloaded the HTML file and began taking it apart.
