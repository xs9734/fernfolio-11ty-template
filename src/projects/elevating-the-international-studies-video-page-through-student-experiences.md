## **Project Overview**

The Center for International Studies provides information and services to potential and admitted international students.

## My Role

As a team we conducted user research, shared our findings. Then worked individually on different pages of the department's website, creating wireframes, prototypes while keeping communicator to ensure a uniform design. My focus was on redesigning the Video Gallery page.

## User Research

To kick off the redesign, we interviewed four international students to gather their first impressions and expectations of the Video Gallery. This research phase was instrumental in shaping our understanding of user perspectives.

Upon delving into our initial interviews, a clear narrative emerged as our interviewees expressed their first impressions of the Video Gallery: a sense of clutter, an outdated feel, challenges in navigation, and an overwhelming influx of information. Recognizing a prevalent interest in student interviews and a desire to declutter the webpage, our strategic decision emerged: to reorganize the video content by relocating videos on various topics to relevant webpages. With a deliberate focus on the power of personal narratives, we opted to center the Video Gallery around "Student Stories." This shift aims to create a more intimate and engaging webpage, allowing prospective students to connect on a personal level and gain a firsthand perspective on the experiences shared by their peers.

## Ideation & Concept

The team convened to brainstorm ways of infusing a more personal touch into the page, collectively agreeing that a singular long list of videos might not offer the optimal user experience. To address this, we introduced a visually appealing solution: video cards. Each card features the student's name, a concise quote, and their country of origin, providing a snapshot that not only organizes the content but also adds a personal and relatable dimension to the user interface.

## Wireframes

Recognizing the shortcomings of the original Video Gallery page, special attention was given to incorporating navigation guidelines into the wireframes. This involved a careful redesign process to ensure alignment with the broader website redesign initiative. Simultaneously, the wireframes embraced the layout principles seen on video-sharing platforms like YouTube, with a significant focus on a large video preview accompanied by relevant text.

## Results & Takeaways

Throughout the redesign process, I engaged in multiple iterative cycles, carefully incorporating user feedback at each stage. A key focus area was enhancing accessibility by including video transcripts. Adhering to the design and branding guidelines set by CSU East Bay, I ensured a cohesive and brand-aligned user experience. Positive feedback from our interviewees indicated satisfaction and appreciation for the introduced changes.
